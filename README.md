# Neural Complexity Measures

Implementation of [Neural Complexity Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02953) (NeurIPS 2020) by Yoonho Lee et al on a multitask dataset with multiple regression tasks and mutiple multiclass classification tasks. 

Done as the final project for CSE663: Meta-Learning offered in Winter'22 at IIIT-Delhi. Along with the basic implementation, we also propose Uncertainty Aware Gap Estimation, which takes uncertainty of the meta-learner into account when estimating the generalization gap and showed it improves performance on classification. Further details with results and analysis are present in the report.
